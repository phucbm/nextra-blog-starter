# Colophon

## Technology

This website is built with **Nextra**, a Next.js-based framework designed specifically for documentation and blog sites. I'm using the blog theme with full **TypeScript support**—something I had to configure myself since the official Nextra documentation doesn't provide fully typed examples out of the box.

For styling, I use **Tailwind CSS** combined with **shadcn/ui** components, which gives me a solid foundation of accessible, customizable UI primitives while maintaining full control over the design system.

The site is deployed on **Vercel**, which provides seamless integration with Next.js and excellent performance out of the box.

## Features

### Content Management

All content is written in **MDX** and lives in the `/content` folder. This keeps things organized and makes it easy to manage posts, drafts, and other written material separately from the codebase.

### Search

The site uses **Pagefind** for search functionality—a static search library recommended by Nextra that's fast, privacy-friendly, and requires no backend infrastructure.

### Tags System

I've enhanced the default tags system to make content discovery easier. You can browse posts by topic and find related content through intelligent tagging.

### Comments

Comments are powered by **Giscus**, a comments system backed by GitHub Discussions. It's privacy-respecting, spam-free, and integrates naturally with my developer workflow.
