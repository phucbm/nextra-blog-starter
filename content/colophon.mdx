# Colophon

## About

This is a personal space where I share my thoughts on web development, design, and technology. I built this site to learn, experiment, and document my journey as a developer. You can expect to find technical articles, experiments, and occasional musings about building for the web.

The design and content evolve as I learn new things—expect frequent updates and tweaks as I continue to refine both the code and the aesthetic.

## Technology

This website is built with **Next.js**, a React framework that enables server-side rendering and static site generation. It's deployed on **Vercel**, which provides seamless integration with Next.js and excellent performance out of the box.

For styling, I use **Tailwind CSS**, a utility-first framework that makes it easy to create responsive, maintainable designs without writing extensive custom CSS. The component architecture follows modern React patterns with TypeScript for type safety.

The content is written in **MDX**, allowing me to seamlessly blend Markdown with React components. This gives me the flexibility to create rich, interactive content while keeping the writing experience simple.

## Design

### Typography

The site uses three carefully selected typefaces:

1. **Inter** — For body text and UI elements. Clean, legible, and optimized for screens.
2. **JetBrains Mono** — For code blocks and technical content. A monospace font designed for developers.
3. **Herbik** — For headings and special emphasis. Adds character and visual hierarchy.

### Colors

The color palette was inspired by various design systems and personal preferences. I aimed for a balance between readability and aesthetic appeal, with a focus on accessibility and reduced eye strain.

### Icons

Icons throughout the site are from **Hero Icons**, a beautiful set of hand-crafted SVG icons that integrate perfectly with Tailwind CSS.

## Writing

I write in a conversational style with minimal editing. My approach to content:

- Use sentence case for titles and headings
- Keep paragraphs short and scannable
- Use em dashes without spaces—like this
- End list items with periods when they're complete sentences
- Link text should describe the destination, not use generic terms like "click here"
- Code examples should be clear and practical
