# Hey, I'm John ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software engineer who builds things for the web. I write about code, share what I learn, and occasionally have opinions about technology.

## What I Do

I work with modern web technologiesâ€”React, TypeScript, Next.js, and whatever else gets the job done. Most of my time is spent turning coffee into code and bugs into features.

## What You'll Find Here

This blog is where I document my journey, share tutorials, and write about problems I've solved (or created). Expect posts about web development, software engineering, and the occasional deep dive into something I find interesting.
