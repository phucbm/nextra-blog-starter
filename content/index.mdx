I'm Felix, a developer who believes good code should be both functional and beautiful. I spend my time building web applications and experimenting with modern frameworks.

I've contributed to several projects ranging from e-commerce platforms to developer tools. Most of my work focuses on creating intuitive user experiences with clean, maintainable code.

You can explore my projects and writing throughout this site.
